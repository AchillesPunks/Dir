As such it offers full support for its exposed intents as described in [OI File Manager - Information for developers](http://openintents.org/filemanager). If your app utilizes any of these intents, your users can safely use Dir instead of OIFM and get the exact same functionality, through the exact same API.","google":"UA-50526431-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
